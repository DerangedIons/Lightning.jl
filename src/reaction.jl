    PointwiseODEFunction(ion, xs, overrides, nnodes, nstates, φ_symbol, state_symbol)

Reaction half of the split: the cell model `ion` evaluated independently at every node.

The solution vector is **state-blocked** (structure of arrays):

```
u = [φₘ(1:N); s₁(1:N); s₂(1:N); … ; s_{M-1}(1:N)]
```

so node `i`'s full state is the strided slice `u[i:N:N*M]` and each *state* is contiguous.
That layout is what makes the split cheap: the diffusion half acts on `φₘ` alone, which is
the contiguous leading block `1:N`, so its dof range needs no synchronizer object and no
gather/scatter. It is also the coalesced layout on a GPU — neighbouring threads read
neighbouring nodes of the same state.

Fields beyond the kinetics — `nnodes`, `nstates`, and the two symbols — are metadata for
the solution helpers in `solution.jl`; the right-hand side itself uses only the first
three plus the two counts.

Not constructed directly; [`semidiscretize`](@ref) builds it.
