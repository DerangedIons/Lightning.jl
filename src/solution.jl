    create_initial_condition(f::GenericSplitFunction, [T]) -> AbstractVector{T}

Allocate the solution vector and fill every node with the cell model's
`default_initial_state`, on the same device the semidiscretization lives on.

`T` defaults to the grid's coordinate element type (`Float64` for a `Float64` grid), so
the initial condition matches the operator rather than silently mixing precisions.

This is the *spatially uniform* starting point. Impose structure on top of it with
[`setvariable!`](@ref) — an initial voltage profile, a heterogeneous gating state, and so
on.

!!! warning "Not necessarily a resting state"
    `default_initial_state` is whatever the cell model ships. For `ToRORd` it is not
    pre-paced (`dφₘ/dt ≈ +240 mV/ms` at `t = 0`); pace a single cell first and
    `setvariable!` the settled values if the opening transient matters.

### Examples

setvariable!(u₀, f, :φₘ) do x
    x[1] < 1.0 ? 1.0 : 0.0

    getvariable(u, f::GenericSplitFunction, name::Symbol) -> SubArray

View of one named block of the solution vector.

`name` is a cell-model state name, the model's `φ_symbol` (`:φₘ` by default, aliasing
whichever state the cell model reports as the transmembrane potential), or its
`state_symbol` (`:states` by default) for the whole non-voltage block.

Being a view, writing through it writes the solution.

### Examples

```julia
φ = getvariable(u, f, :φₘ)      # length N
s = getvariable(u, f, :states)  # length N*(M-1), all non-voltage states
w = getvariable(u, f, :CaMKt)   # length N, one named state

"""
    setvariable!(fun, u, f::GenericSplitFunction, name::Symbol) -> u
    setvariable!(u, f::GenericSplitFunction, name::Symbol, value::Number) -> u

Fill one named state block by evaluating `fun(x)` at every node's cell-center coordinate,
or with a constant `value`.

Reads naturally with `do`-block syntax, since the function is the first argument.

`name` must name a single state (a cell-model state name or the model's `φ_symbol`); the
whole-state-block symbol is rejected, because one function of position cannot say what to
put in each of several states.
